# EPOUpdater
Bare-bones Android EPO Updater for MTK-based phones

Mind that this is my first Android app and my only goal was to get something that does what I want,
 not something that looks fancy.

Suggestions for improvements: add a daemon that updates EPO at regular intervals. A preferences menu
 should be added to choose the interval, and whether to do it on WiFi only or any data connection.
